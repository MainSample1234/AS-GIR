### Using Audio Spectrogram Transformer with SVM as a downstream classifier
Recognition and interpretation of bird vocalizations are piv-
otal in ornithological research and ecological conservation
efforts due to their significance in understanding avian be-
haviour, performing habitat assessment and judging ecolog-
ical health. This paper presents an audio spectrogram-
guided classification framework called ASGIR for improved
bird sound recognition and information retrieval. Our work
is accompanied by a simple-to-use, two-step information re-
trieval system that uses geographical location and bird sounds
to localize and retrieve relevant bird information by scrap-
ing Wikipedia page information of recognized birds. AS-
GIR offers a substantial performance on a random subset of
51 classes of Xeno-Canto dataset Bird sounds from European
countries with a median of 100% performance on F1, Preci-
sion and Sensitivity metrics.
