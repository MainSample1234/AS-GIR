### Using Audio Spectrogram Transformer with SVM as a downstream classifier
Recognition and interpretation of bird vocalizations are pivotal in ornithological research and ecological conservation efforts due to their significance in understanding avian behavior, performing habitat assessment, and judging ecological health. This paper presents an audio spectrogram-guided classification framework called ASGIR for improved bird sound recognition and information retrieval. Our work is accompanied by a simple-to-use, two-step information retrieval system that uses geographical location and bird sounds to localize and retrieve relevant bird information by scraping Wikipedia page information of recognized birds. ASGIR offers substantial performance on a random subset of 51 classes of Xeno-Canto dataset bird sounds from European countries with a median of 100% performance on F1, Precision, and Sensitivity metrics.
